  description: Sardine and pilchard are common names for various species of small,
    oily forage fish in the herring family Clupeidae. The term 'sardine' was first
    used in English during the early 15th century; a somewhat dubious etymology says
    it comes from the Italian island of Sardinia, around which sardines were once
    supposedly abundant.
